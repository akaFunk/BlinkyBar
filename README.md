# LEDStrip
The LEDStrip is a modular LED light painting device based on the WS2812B programmable RGB LEDs. It features modules with a length of approximately 250mm, which can be attached to a master module of an arbitrary length. The master module holds a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which provides access to the device with a Wifi access point. A website running on the Raspi allows to upload an image. Once the trigger button on the master module is pressed, the image is played back one column after another. Combining this with a long time expose will paint the uploaded image into thin air.

We are currently working on the first release. Images made with an earlier version are shown below. This older version featured only 60 LEDs per meter, while the new one will have 180 LEDs per meter.
